    description:
      "The UAE offers multiple pathways to residency, from standard employment visas (2-3 year validity) to the prestigious Golden Visa (5-10 years). As a business owner, you can sponsor your own investor visa through your company, bring employees on employment visas, and sponsor family members for dependent visas. The process involves multiple government departments — immigration, labor, medical, and Emirates ID — each with specific requirements and timelines. We coordinate the entire journey, from entry permit issuance to Emirates ID collection, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. Whether you're relocating a team of 50 or just need your own residence sorted, we make the process predictable.",

      {
        question: "How long does a standard visa process take?",
        answer:
          "From document submission to Emirates ID collection, typically 5-10 working days for employment and investor visas. Golden Visa applications take 2-4 weeks due to additional verification. Timeline assumes all documents are correct and complete.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to be in the UAE to apply for a visa?",
        answer:
          "For initial applications, you can receive an entry permit while abroad and enter UAE to complete the process (medical, biometrics, stamping). For renewals and most changes, you need to be in the UAE. We coordinate timing to minimize your trips.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between investor and employment visa?",
        answer:
          "An investor visa is sponsored by your own company (you're both sponsor and sponsored). An employment visa is sponsored by another company as their employee. Investor visas are tied to your business license; employment visas are tied to your employer.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I qualify for Golden Visa?",
        answer:
          "Key pathways include: investors with AED 2M+ in property or business, entrepreneurs with approved projects, executives earning AED 30,000+ monthly, and specialized talents in science, medicine, or arts. We assess your eligibility and recommend the strongest application route.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I sponsor my family with an investor visa?",
        answer:
          "Yes. With a valid UAE residence visa and minimum salary/income requirements (typically AED 4,000+ or AED 3,000+ with accommodation), you can sponsor your spouse and children. Parents may also be sponsored under certain conditions.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if my visa is rejected?",
        answer:
          "Rejections are rare with proper preparation (our first-time approval rate is 98%). If issues arise, we identify the cause, address it, and resubmit. Common issues include document discrepancies, medical findings, or security checks — all manageable with the right approach.",
