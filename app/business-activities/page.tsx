              <p>
                Every UAE trade license lists specific "activities" that define what your
                company can legally do. Activities are standardized codes maintained by
                DED (for mainland) or individual free zone authorities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Choosing the right activities matters: too narrow and you can't serve all
                your customers; too broad and you might face higher fees or unnecessary
                approvals. Most businesses need 3-6 well-chosen activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some activities require special approvals (healthcare needs DHA, food needs
                municipality, education needs KHDA). Others are restricted to certain license
                types or jurisdictions. We help you navigate these requirements.

                  Think 2-3 years ahead. Adding activities later is possible but involves
                  fees and processing time. Better to include likely future activities now.

                  Your description needs to map to official DED or free zone activity codes.
