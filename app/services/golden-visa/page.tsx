    description:
      "The UAE Golden Visa grants 5 or 10-year renewable residency to investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, outstanding students, and humanitarian pioneers. Unlike standard visas tied to employment, the Golden Visa provides stability — you can live, work, and sponsor family members without a national sponsor, and your visa remains valid even during extended stays abroad. For business owners, this means freedom to operate across emirates, sponsor unlimited employees, and build long-term plans without visa renewal uncertainty. For investors, it signals commitment and opens doors that short-term visas cannot. The eligibility criteria have expanded significantly since the program launched, with multiple pathways now available for real estate investors, company owners, freelancers with specialized skills, and exceptional talents in various fields. We assess your profile against all available categories and identify the strongest application pathway. Our team handles document preparation, authority submissions, and follow-ups — you receive your Golden Visa without navigating the bureaucratic complexity yourself.",

    items: [
      {
        question: "What are the main Golden Visa categories?",
        answer:
          "The main categories are: Investors (AED 2M+ in property, public investments, or company capital), Entrepreneurs (startup founders with prior exit or incubator backing), Specialized Talents (doctors, scientists, engineers, artists with exceptional achievements), Outstanding Students (top performers from UAE or global universities), and Humanitarian Pioneers (recognized for charitable work). Each category has specific requirements we help you navigate.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much investment is required for the investor category?",
        answer:
          "For real estate: minimum AED 2 million property value (can be mortgaged up to 50% for properties over AED 4M). For company investors: AED 2 million in company capital or ownership of a company with AED 2M+ revenue. For public investments: AED 2 million in approved investment funds or deposits. Multiple smaller investments can sometimes be combined.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I apply if I don't live in the UAE yet?",
        answer:
          "Yes. You can apply for a Golden Visa from outside the UAE if you meet eligibility criteria (e.g., property ownership, company shareholding). You'll need to enter the UAE to complete biometrics and medical tests, but the initial application and approval can be processed remotely.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between 5-year and 10-year Golden Visa?",
        answer:
          "The 10-year Golden Visa is available for investors and specialized talents with higher thresholds. The 5-year Golden Visa covers entrepreneurs, exceptional students, and some talent categories. Both are renewable and provide similar benefits — the main difference is duration and specific eligibility requirements for each tier.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I sponsor my parents with the Golden Visa?",
        answer:
          "Yes — this is a unique benefit of the Golden Visa. Standard residence visas only allow sponsoring spouse and children. Golden Visa holders can also sponsor parents, providing them with renewable residence visas without the usual age or financial guarantee requirements.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if my investment value drops below the threshold?",
        answer:
          "For property investments, the AED 2M threshold is assessed at the time of visa application/renewal, not continuously. However, selling the property that qualified you would affect renewal eligibility. We advise on maintaining qualification throughout your visa period.",
