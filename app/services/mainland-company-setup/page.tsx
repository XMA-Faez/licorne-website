      "A Dubai mainland company (also called DED or onshore company) gives you unrestricted access to trade anywhere in the UAE. Unlike free zone companies, mainland businesses can bid on government contracts, operate retail locations anywhere in Dubai, and work directly with UAE-based clients without intermediaries. The trade-off is the requirement for a local service agent or sponsor for certain license types — but we handle that arrangement entirely, ensuring you maintain full operational control while meeting regulatory requirements. Mainland setup is ideal for businesses targeting the local market, service providers needing a physical presence, and companies planning to scale across the Emirates.",

      {
        question: "Do I need a local sponsor for a mainland company?",
        answer:
          "It depends on your activity. Since 2021, over 1,000 commercial activities allow 100% foreign ownership. However, some activities (particularly those involving government contracts or specific regulated sectors) still require a UAE national service agent. We'll advise you on the best structure during consultation.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between mainland and free zone?",
        answer:
          "Mainland companies can trade directly anywhere in the UAE, open multiple branches, and bid on government contracts. Free zone companies are limited to operating within their zone or internationally. Mainland requires an office lease (Ejari), while free zones offer flexi-desk options. We help you choose based on your business model.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does mainland company setup take?",
        answer:
          "Typically 5-10 working days from document submission to license issuance. The timeline can extend if you need special approvals (e.g., for regulated activities) or if there are delays in office lease registration.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the costs involved?",
        answer:
          "Costs vary based on license type, number of activities, office requirements, and visa needs. A basic mainland LLC starts around AED 15,000-25,000 including government fees, but we provide an itemized quote after understanding your specific requirements.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I convert a free zone company to mainland later?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but it requires establishing a new mainland entity and transferring operations. It's more efficient to choose the right structure from the start — which is why we spend time understanding your long-term plans during consultation.",
      },
      {
        question: "How many visas can I get with a mainland license?",
        answer:
          "Visa quota depends on your office space size, roughly calculated at one visa per 9 square meters. Unlike free zones with fixed visa packages, mainland offers flexibility to scale your team as your office space grows.",
