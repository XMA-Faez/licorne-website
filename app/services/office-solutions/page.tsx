    description:
      "Every Dubai business needs a registered address — but not every business needs a full office from day one. We provide flexible office solutions that match your actual needs, whether you're a solo consultant working remotely, a growing team needing hot desks, or an established business requiring dedicated space. Virtual offices provide a prestigious business address and mail handling without physical space — perfect for licensing requirements when you work from home or travel frequently. Flexi desks offer shared workspace access with business center amenities when you need professional meeting spaces occasionally. Serviced offices provide fully-furnished, ready-to-use private offices with reception, utilities, and IT included — ideal for teams that need dedicated space without fit-out hassles. We partner with business centers across Dubai's key locations: Downtown, DIFC, Business Bay, JLT, and free zones. Our relationships mean competitive rates and flexible terms that property managers don't offer to walk-in clients. More importantly, we ensure your office solution meets licensing requirements — because not every virtual office qualifies for every license type.",

    items: [
      {
        question: "Can I use a virtual office address for my trade license?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but not all virtual offices are license-approved. We only recommend virtual office providers whose addresses are accepted by DED and free zone authorities for license registration. This is crucial — choosing the wrong provider means your license application gets rejected.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the minimum commitment for serviced offices?",
        answer:
          "Most serviced offices require 6-12 month minimum commitments, though some offer 3-month terms at premium rates. Through our partnerships, we can sometimes negotiate shorter terms or break clauses. Virtual offices and flexi desks typically offer monthly renewals.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which locations are best for different business types?",
        answer:
          "DIFC and Downtown for finance and consulting, Dubai Media City for creative industries, JAFZA and DAFZA for trading companies, Business Bay for general commercial, JLT for cost-effective professional space. We advise based on your industry, client expectations, and budget.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need physical office space for visa processing?",
        answer:
          "For mainland licenses, you need at least an Ejari (tenancy contract) which virtual offices can provide. Free zones have specific office requirements per visa quota — some require physical space, others accept flexi desk arrangements. We ensure your office solution supports your visa needs.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I upgrade from virtual office to physical space later?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely — this is a common progression. Start with virtual address for licensing, add flexi desk access when you need workspace, then transition to serviced office as your team grows. We manage the address changes with authorities to keep your license updated.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's included in serviced office pricing?",
        answer:
          "Typically includes: furnished space, reception and telephone answering, WiFi and IT infrastructure, utilities (electricity, AC, water), cleaning, maintenance, and access to meeting rooms (usually limited free hours, then hourly rates). Confirm specifics as inclusions vary by provider.",
