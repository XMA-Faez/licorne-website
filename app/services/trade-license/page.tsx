    description:
      "Your trade license is the legal foundation of your UAE business. It defines what activities you can perform, where you can operate, and your compliance obligations. Getting it right from the start — and keeping it current — is essential for smooth operations. Beyond initial licensing, businesses regularly need amendments: adding new activities as you expand, updating shareholder information after ownership changes, changing trade names, or modifying legal structures. Each change requires specific procedures with the Department of Economic Development (DED) or relevant free zone authority. We handle the full spectrum of trade license services. For new businesses, we advise on activity selection and license structure. For existing businesses, we manage renewals well before expiry dates and process amendments efficiently. Our PRO team knows the procedures, timelines, and document requirements for every type of license modification — saving you from rejected applications, delays, and the frustration of navigating government systems without experience.",

    title: "Frequently asked questions about trade licenses",
    items: [
      {
        question: "When should I start my license renewal process?",
        answer:
          "We recommend starting 30 days before expiry. This provides buffer time for any unexpected issues — document updates, outstanding fees, or approval delays. Operating with an expired license can result in fines and restrictions on visa processing. We send automatic reminders to managed clients.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I add any business activity to my existing license?",
        answer:
          "Most activities can be added, but some require additional approvals (e.g., food trading needs municipality approval, educational activities need KHDA approval). Some activities are restricted to specific license types or may require a separate license entirely. We advise on the best approach for your expansion plans.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does a license amendment take?",
        answer:
          "Simple amendments (manager change, address update) typically complete in 1-3 working days. Activity additions may take 3-7 days depending on approval requirements. Shareholder changes involving share transfers take 5-10 days. We provide accurate timelines based on your specific amendment.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between instant license and commercial license?",
        answer:
          "Instant licenses (available in some free zones and Dubai mainland) allow you to start operating immediately with limited activities and simplified requirements. Commercial licenses provide full operational scope but require office space, approvals, and more documentation. Many businesses start with instant and upgrade later.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I change my company's trade name?",
        answer:
          "Yes, trade names can be changed subject to availability and naming guidelines. The process involves reserving the new name, updating all company documents, and re-issuing licenses and registrations. Name changes typically take 5-7 working days and require updating bank accounts, visas, and other records.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if my license expires?",
        answer:
          "Expired licenses incur late renewal fines (typically 2-4% per month of delay). More importantly, you cannot process visas, open bank accounts, or legally operate until renewed. Extended expiry may lead to license cancellation. If your license has expired, contact us immediately for expedited renewal.",
