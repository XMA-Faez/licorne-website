    description:
      "PRO (Public Relations Officer) services cover all interactions between your business and UAE government authorities. This includes everything from routine license renewals and visa processing to document attestation, trade name amendments, and activity changes. In Dubai, navigating government departments requires knowing the right procedures, having the right documents, and often — being physically present during working hours. Our PRO team handles this daily. We know which counter to visit, which documents to bring, and how to resolve issues when they arise. For businesses without a dedicated PRO on staff, we become your government relations department — ensuring deadlines are met, documents are processed, and your business stays compliant without you spending hours in queues.",

      {
        question: "What is a PRO and why do I need one?",
        answer:
          "A PRO (Public Relations Officer) handles all government interactions on behalf of your company. Unless you have staff with UAE government experience and time to visit offices during working hours, outsourcing PRO services ensures your compliance tasks are completed efficiently and on time.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much notice do you need for license renewals?",
        answer:
          "Ideally 2-3 weeks before expiry, though we can handle urgent renewals. We recommend setting up proactive tracking — we'll remind you 30 days before any deadline so you're never caught off-guard.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can you handle document attestation for personal use?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We attest educational certificates (for employment or visa purposes), personal documents (marriage certificates, birth certificates), and commercial documents. Process varies by document type and destination country.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's included in your monthly PRO package?",
        answer:
          "Our packages typically cover routine services like visa renewals, document submissions, and standard government correspondence. Volume-based pricing works for businesses with predictable needs. We also offer pay-per-service for occasional requirements.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you cover all emirates or just Dubai?",
        answer:
          "We primarily serve Dubai and Abu Dhabi but can coordinate services across all UAE emirates. Government procedures vary by emirate, and our team knows the specific requirements for each.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I track the status of my requests?",
