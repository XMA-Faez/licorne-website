      "Opening a corporate bank account in the UAE has become increasingly challenging due to enhanced compliance requirements. Banks scrutinize business models, source of funds, expected transaction volumes, and beneficial ownership structures. Many new businesses face rejection or endless document requests without understanding why. We've built relationships with relationship managers across major UAE banks and understand exactly what each institution requires. More importantly, we know which banks are suitable for different business types — a trading company, a consultancy, and an e-commerce business each need different banking solutions. Our preparation includes anticipating compliance questions, structuring your application correctly, and accompanying you to meetings when needed. The result: higher approval rates and faster account activation.",

    items: [
      {
        question: "Why is opening a bank account in UAE so difficult?",
        answer:
          "UAE banks operate under strict compliance frameworks (anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing). New businesses without UAE track records are considered higher risk. Banks are cautious about business models they don't understand, unclear source of funds, and complex ownership structures. Proper preparation addresses these concerns upfront.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which banks do you work with?",
        answer:
          "We have relationships with Emirates NBD, ADCB, Mashreq, RAK Bank, CBD, FAB, and several others including international banks with UAE presence. Bank selection depends on your business type — some banks are better for trading companies, others for service businesses or tech startups.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does account opening take?",
        answer:
          "From application to active account: typically 2-4 weeks. This varies by bank, business complexity, and how quickly you provide additional documents if requested. Some banks are faster than others — we factor this into recommendations for time-sensitive situations.",
      },
      {
        question: "What documents are typically required?",
        answer:
          "Standard requirements include: trade license, MOA, passport copies of shareholders, proof of address, CV/background of owners, business plan or company profile, expected transaction details, and source of funds documentation. Specific requirements vary by bank.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if my application is rejected?",
        answer:
          "We analyze the rejection reason (if provided) and either address the issue for reapplication or recommend an alternative bank more suited to your profile. Our pre-screening significantly reduces rejection risk, but if it happens, we don't charge for the follow-up application.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can you help with multi-currency or international accounts?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Many UAE banks offer multi-currency accounts, and we can also facilitate introductions to international banks with UAE presence if your business requires specific capabilities like trade finance, LC facilities, or particular currency corridors.",
