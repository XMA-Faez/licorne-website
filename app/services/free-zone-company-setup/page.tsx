    description:
      "Dubai's 30+ free zones offer distinct advantages: complete foreign ownership without a local sponsor, corporate tax exemptions (0% for qualifying income), 100% repatriation of profits, and simplified import/export procedures. Each free zone caters to specific industries — from DMCC for commodities trading to Dubai Internet City for tech companies, Dubai Healthcare City for medical practices, and JAFZA for logistics. The key is matching your business to the right zone. We've helped hundreds of entrepreneurs navigate this choice, avoiding costly mistakes like registering in zones that don't support their activities or overpaying for packages they don't need. Free zones are ideal for businesses focused on international trade, remote services, or industries with dedicated zones.",

        question: "Which free zone is best for my business?",
        answer:
          "It depends on your industry, target market, budget, and visa needs. Tech companies often choose DIFC or Dubai Internet City. Trading businesses prefer DMCC or JAFZA. E-commerce works well in Dubai CommerCity. We analyze your specific case to recommend the best fit — avoiding zones that seem cheap but restrict your activities.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can a free zone company work with UAE clients?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but with limitations. Free zone companies can invoice UAE mainland clients for services, but selling physical goods in the UAE requires going through a mainland distributor or customs clearance procedures. For businesses primarily targeting UAE customers, mainland may be more suitable.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the cost difference between free zones?",
        answer:
          "Significant. A basic package in RAK Free Trade Zone starts around AED 12,000, while DIFC (Dubai's financial center) starts at AED 50,000+. The cheapest option isn't always best — we help you understand what's included, what's extra, and total cost of ownership.",
      },
      {
        question: "How many visas do I get with a free zone license?",
        answer:
          "Most free zone packages include 3-6 visa allocations. Additional visas can be purchased, typically AED 5,000-8,000 per visa. Some zones like IFZA are known for generous visa packages at competitive rates.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need a physical office in the free zone?",
        answer:
          "Most free zones offer flexi-desk (virtual office) options sufficient for license issuance. However, some activities require a physical presence. We advise on the minimum requirements for your specific activity and whether upgrading makes sense for your operations.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I convert a free zone company to mainland?",
        answer:
          "Not directly — you'd need to establish a separate mainland entity. However, a free zone company can open a mainland branch for local UAE trading. We help structure this correctly from the start to avoid costly restructuring later.",
