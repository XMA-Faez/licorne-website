    description:
      "Closing a UAE business requires more than just stopping operations. Licenses must be formally cancelled, employee visas terminated, bank accounts closed, VAT deregistered, and various authorities notified in the correct sequence. Skip a step, and you face ongoing renewal fees, visa complications, or legal exposure. Many business owners discover closure is more complex than setup. The process varies significantly between mainland and free zone companies, with different timelines, document requirements, and approval processes. Free zones may require audited accounts and published notices; mainland requires immigration clearance and DED procedures. We manage the entire liquidation process — from initial assessment of obligations through to final cancellation certificates. Our approach ensures shareholders are protected from future claims, employees are properly offboarded, and there are no loose ends that resurface months later. Whether you're closing due to business completion, restructuring, or simply moving on, we make the exit as clean as your entry.",

    items: [
      {
        question: "How long does company closure take in Dubai?",
        answer:
          "Typical timelines: 8-12 weeks for straightforward closures, 12-16 weeks for companies with multiple visas or complex situations. Free zones sometimes process faster than mainland. Delays usually come from outstanding obligations (unpaid fees, active visas, pending VAT) rather than processing time.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I close my company if I have outstanding debts?",
        answer:
          "Debts must be settled before formal liquidation. This includes supplier payments, employee settlements, government fees, and bank facilities. We help assess total obligations and can negotiate payment plans if needed. Attempting closure with outstanding debts creates legal exposure.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens to employees when I close?",
        answer:
          "Employees must be properly terminated with notice period (or payment in lieu), final settlement including gratuity, and visa cancellation allowing them to transfer to new employers. We handle the paperwork and ensure compliance with UAE labour law requirements.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to be in the UAE to close my company?",
        answer:
          "Most closure steps can be handled with Power of Attorney if you're outside UAE. However, some stages (particularly shareholder visa cancellation if you hold one) may require brief presence. We advise on timing to minimize trips if you've already relocated.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if my trade license already expired?",
        answer:
          "Expired licenses require renewal and payment of accumulated fines before cancellation can proceed. While frustrating, this is unavoidable — you cannot cancel an expired license without settling renewal fees first. We calculate total costs upfront so there are no surprises.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I reopen a business after liquidation?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Company liquidation doesn't prevent you from starting a new business in UAE. However, you cannot simply reactivate a cancelled license — you would need to go through new company formation. Any debts or issues from the closed company must be fully resolved first.",
