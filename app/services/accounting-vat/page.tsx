    description:
      "The UAE introduced VAT in 2018, and businesses meeting threshold requirements must register, file returns, and maintain compliant records. Beyond VAT, companies need accurate financial records for bank relationships, investor reporting, free zone compliance, and audit requirements. Many businesses struggle with accounting not because they lack capability, but because they lack time. Founders focus on sales and operations while bookkeeping falls behind. Suddenly, VAT filing deadline arrives and there's a scramble to reconstruct months of transactions. Or the bank requests financial statements and there's nothing current to provide. We offer practical accounting support scaled to business size. Startups might need basic bookkeeping and quarterly VAT filing. Growing companies might need monthly management reports and cash flow forecasting. Established businesses might need full-service accounting with CFO-level insights. Our team includes UAE-qualified accountants who understand local requirements — Tally and Zoho Books proficiency, FTA portal navigation, and free zone reporting standards. We integrate with your existing systems rather than forcing software changes, and we communicate in business terms rather than accounting jargon.",

    items: [
      {
        question: "Does my business need to register for VAT?",
        answer:
          "VAT registration is mandatory if your taxable supplies and imports exceed AED 375,000 over 12 months. Voluntary registration is available above AED 187,500. Some free zone companies have specific VAT considerations. We assess your situation and advise on registration timing and implications.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I miss a VAT filing deadline?",
        answer:
          "Late filing incurs penalties: AED 1,000 for first offense, AED 2,000 for repeat offenses within 24 months. Late payment of VAT due adds further penalties. We've maintained 100% on-time filing for all clients — deadlines are non-negotiable in our service.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can you work with our existing accounting software?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We work with Zoho Books, QuickBooks, Xero, Tally, and Excel-based systems. If you're not yet on software, we can recommend and implement appropriate solutions. We adapt to your systems rather than forcing changes.",
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I update my books?",
        answer:
          "At minimum, monthly — in time for VAT quarters. Many businesses benefit from fortnightly or weekly updates for better visibility. We recommend frequency based on transaction volume and how actively you use financial data for decisions.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you handle corporate tax as well?",
        answer:
          "Yes. With UAE corporate tax now in effect for financial years starting June 2023, we provide corporate tax registration, compliance advisory, and return preparation. This is especially relevant for businesses exceeding AED 375,000 annual profit threshold.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between bookkeeping and accounting?",
        answer:
          "Bookkeeping is transaction recording — data entry, categorization, reconciliation. Accounting includes analysis, reporting, and interpretation of that data. We offer both: accurate bookkeeping foundations plus meaningful financial insights.",
